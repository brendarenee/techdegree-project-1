        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring front-end web developer and working on my education and experience through Team Treehouse and Orange Coast College (Costa Mesa, CA). I have worked for 10 years in the social services field and have decided to switch gears by becoming a full-time tech student. I love to problem-solve and learn new things.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I love to travel, read, do yoga, and garden. While in school I studied and lived in both the United Kingdom and Mexico. I love the order, routine, and rules of coding, but I also like wandering into unknown territory with passion. Becoming a tech student is a new landscape for me and I can't wait to find out what comes next.</p>
