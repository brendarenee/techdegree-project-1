        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring front-end web developer and working on my education and experience through Team Treehouse and Orange Coast College (in Costa Mesa, CA). I have taken a number of formal classes and am now pursuing the online Front End Web Development Techdegree through Team Treehouse. I love the process of building my own sites and learning through practice. The most rewarding part of the the process has been problem-solving to ensure everything continues to work as needed on my sites.</p>
        <p>I also bring skills from my previous professional career in social services. I received my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sociology in 2007 and since then I have worked as a childcare worker and case manager for both current and former foster youth. In 2013, I started working for the county government as an eligibility worker for the Food Stamps Program. Throughout my career I have accumulated a number of transferable skills including: customer service, troubleshooting, file management, organization, communication, and connecting with the community.</p>

        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
        <p>In my spare time I love to travel, read, do yoga, and garden. I list the gardening last, because while I love greenery, I have somewhat of a brown thumb. But I am convinced I can change that. So far, my succulents continue to thrive.</p>
        <p>While in school I studied and lived in both the United Kingdom and Mexico. I have also traveled to 9 different countries and multiple states across the US.Here is a slide show of some of my travels:</p>
